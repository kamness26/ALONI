# 🧘‍♂️ ALONI – Automated Login Optimizer for Namaste Intervals

> *Born October 16, 2025 – The day the bot learned to book itself.*

ALONI is an autonomous automation system built with Python and Playwright that securely logs in, navigates class schedules, and books sessions on your behalf.  
Designed for reliability, flexibility, and mindful automation — it brings the practice of presence to the world of code.

## 💡 About the Name
ALONI began as a challenge.

A developer once said this couldn’t be done without a technical background.  
So Kam built it anyway — and named the system after him.
